*A microservice based Flask app exploring a variety of cocktail receipes*

* <u>Technologies:</u> Python, HTML, CSS, AWS, Docker
* Employed Agile practices for project management and utilized Docker for containerized deployment (previously deployed with an AWS microservice).
* Implemented a user interface allowing searches by name, index, or random selection. Search results confirm valid drink choices, and users can display ingredients, recipes, and pictures with a single click.
* Incorporated a reset button with a confirmation popup to prevent accidental form clearing. The two-page web application adheres to multiple cognitive style heuristics, ensuring user-friendlines.

### [Hashmap Implementation](https://github.com/voyagerfan/Hashmap-Implementation.git)

![](./Icons/hashtag.png)

*A customized hash map class centered on data storage and performance optimization.*

* <u>Technologies:</u> Python, Unittest, GitHub Actions
* Achieves high-efficiency data storage by giving the user two collision avoidance strategies â€“ Open Addressing (OA) and Separate Chaining (SC).
* Employs a modular design by separating the OA and SC functions in different files.
*Both hash map implementations include a holistic suite of functions for insertion, retrieval, deletion, and table management.
* Ensures code quality and functionality with Unittest and GitHub actions to automate building, linting, and testing.


### [Exercise Tracking App](https://github.com/voyagerfan/Exercise-Tracking-App.git)

![](./Icons/exercise.png)

*As a simplified fitness companion, this MERN stack application empowers users to track their exercise routines effectively with a user-friendly interface.*

* <u>Technologies:</u> JavaScript (React.js), Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
* Provides intuitive exercise management by allowing effortless addition of exercises with details such as names, reps, weights, and dates.
* Relays real-time feedback with alert confirmations after each CRUD operation.
* Delivers a seamless user experience by employing single-page application (SPA) architecture.

### [Weather API](https://github.com/voyagerfan/Weather-API.git)

![](./Icons/weather.png)

*This app employs a terminal based UI that allows a user to lookup the current weather of a particular city. A user may also choose a specific map type. Given a valid city name, a map of the city is shown with current weather conditions*

* <u>Technologies</u> : Java, JSON, HTML, Maven, Google Maps API, OpenWeatherMap API
* Streamlines weather inquiries by leveraging Google Maps and OpenWeatherMap to visualize data.
* Affords a customizable UI experience by allowing inputs for map type and zoom level.
* Convenient access to data is achieved with dual display through the console and an HTML pop-up
* Prioritizes scalability, simplified builds, and dependency management with Maven architecture. 

### [Arithemitc Expression Evaluator](https://github.com/voyagerfan/Arithmetic-Expression-Evaluator.git)
