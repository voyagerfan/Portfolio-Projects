*Sunshine Medical is a Flask application that integrates mutliple web pages with SQL querries to perform CRUD operations on a database. The application allows a clinician to enter patient data and transfer patients to different departments for treatment.*


### [Hashmap Implementation](https://github.com/voyagerfan/Hashmap-Implementation.git)

![](./Icons/hashtag.png)

*This hashmap implementation utilizes a linked list and dynamic array to create various functions for two hashmap classes. Class function employ either Open Addressing or Separate Chaining for collision avoidance strategies. The repository includes CI pipelines with Unittest to ensure early bug detection.*

### [Exercise Tracking App](https://github.com/voyagerfan/Exercise-Tracking-App.git)

![](./Icons/exercise.png)

*This full-stack MERN app allows users to log activities, including details like names, reps, weights, and dates. Real-time feedback with alert confirmations provides confidence in data retention. The single-page application (SPA) architecture improves perceived UI performance.*

### [Arithemitc Expression Evaluator](https://github.com/voyagerfan/Arithmetic-Expression-Evaluator.git)

![](./Icons/calculator.png)

*This interactive program prompts users to enter mathematical expressions. It then efficiently converts the expressions from infix notation to postfix notation  and performs the final evaluation.*

### [Extending the Random Class](https://github.com/voyagerfan/Extending-the-Random-Class.git)

![](./Icons/random.png)

*This project extends the Java random class by adding additional functions. It includes a terminal based UI which allows a user to test the extended functions.*

### [Weather API](https://github.com/voyagerfan/Weather-API.git)

![](./Icons/weather.png)

*This app employs a terminal based UI that allows a user to lookup the current weather of a particular city. A user may also choose a specific map type. Given a valid city name, a map of the city is shown with current weather conditions*
